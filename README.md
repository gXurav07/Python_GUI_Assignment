# Python GUI Assignment with Tkinter
In this assignment, I developed a software which helps in detecting objects from an image. The software consists of a Machine Learning model which reads the image as NumPy array and returns information regarding the detected objects. These informations were translated by me to relevant bounding boxes, segmentation masks, names and displayed as output. The model was already given to me and I implemented the entire Graphical User Interface for the software using the Tkinter library of Python. I also used the PIL library of Python to manipulate the images and display the output image in a more user-friendly fashion.
